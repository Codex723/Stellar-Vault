# Stellar-Vault
StellarVault is a decentralized yield aggregator built on Soroban that  implements the SEP-0056 (ERC-4626) standard. It allows users to deposit  assets into secure, non-custodial vaults that automatically deploy  capital into top-tier Stellar DeFi protocols to maximize returns and  socialize gas costs through automated compounding strategies.
